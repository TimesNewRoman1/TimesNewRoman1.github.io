<h2 align="center"> Original Pictures </h2>

<p> First, I cropped the car image and used a fine erase tool to completely
    remove the background from it in order to place it on the backround with a clean edge.
    Then, I placed the modified car onto the background picture of the mountain path, and resized it to fit 
    the picture as original car image was much larger than the background. I then rotated the car 
    picture so that it would sit on the path in the background picture at a more realistic angle. Next, I used a partially transparent 
    black and white filter on the car to make it a darker black so as to have a sleeker look. 
    I then added the explosion picture in the top section to create an action movie sort of effect.
    Then I changed the brightness and contrast of the car, the explosion and the background to create 
    a more uniform look between the layers
    Next, I used the paintbrush tool and the smudge tool to create a shawdow underneath the car and then
    smooth the effect of the paintbrush to make the car look more realistic in the picture.
    Then, I used a clone tool, then the heal tool to make the entire picture more uniform and less choppy overall.
    Finally, I layered text over the picture to make the picture look more like a movie poster.</p>

   <h2 align="center">Fair Use</h1>
	<p>Fair use is any limited copying of a copyrighted material <a href="http://guides.nyu.edu/fairuse"> (Source) </a>
	 Fair use is 
	important for teaching purposes (other than in post-secondary education) 
	when a whole copyrighted material is not necessary, or accessible for all the 
	pupils. It is also important for things like individual research papers and
	personal knowledge so as to provide a broad understanding of certain topics. 
	Fair use is used largely in criticisms, reviews, and parodies of copyrighted 
	work, which can help expand the market for the copyrighted item and provide more 
	potential consumers of the product although it can also be detrimental to future 
	sales of the product, which should be avoided at all costs <a href="http://www.cmsimpact.org/fair-use/related-materials/codes/code-best-practices-fair-use-scholarly-research-communication#one"> (Source) </a>. Finally, it is important
	to consider fair use in news broadcasts and articles where accurate information and 
	clarity are both important. I believe that fair use of materials should be widely used, 
	but have exact restrictions on it in order to prevent copyright infringement problems, 
	and in order for the copyright holder to acquire the compensation fair for the 
	product they have created.</p>

	<p>To begin, I believe that all countries under the Berne agreement should follow 
	the same guidelines for copyright law and fair use, and any change an individual 
	nation wants to make to this agreement must be taken up with the other countries
	under the Berne agreement, and only upon a positive vote from the majority of the
	 countries should the country wishing to change their copyright law be allowed to 
	change it. This would simplify the process and would allow a (mostly) universal 
	agreement so as to prevent a person from being lawful in one country and then not 
	in another, due to minor changes in the copyright law for individual countries. The 
	usage of a copyrighted product should be different depending on if it is being used 
	for private or public usage, for example, large public corporations should be made to 
	pay for the product whereas free public institutions such as schools should not be, and 
	private users should be made to pay for the product only within certain parameters. The 
	next few paragraphs outline some general parameters concerning fair use.</p>

	<p>First, I will discuss the logistics of the internet in concern with fair use and 
	copyright law. I believe that all articles, papers, images, and books posted on the
	 internet should fall under fair use. These items should be allowed to be posted on 
	the internet by the copyright holder alone, but once on the web should be accessible to
	 everyone. There should not be paid memberships necessary in order to use a product on 
	the internet (services should however be under paid copyright if they believe is necessary)
	 concerning fair use on the internet. However, once on the internet, there should be no 
	copying of the fair use item unless specifically for teaching purposes. From there, the 
	fair use item on the internet should be allowed to be used in small portions (unless a picture 
	in which the whole image would probably need to be shown) for personal research, criticism,
	 and news purposes <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#107">(Source)</a>. If any person wants to own a copy of the material or wants to be able to 
	redistribute it outside of a classroom or lecture setting they must pay the fees set by the 
	copyright holder. Fair usage should definitely have different parameters for private and public 
	usage.  All corporations that wish to use the product must pay the copyright holder in order to access 
	the product or the information at a large volume in order to be distributed throughout the company. 
	In this situation the copyright holder can still get monetary compensation while allowing there product 
	to gain popularity and to be used by the general population. </p>

	<p>In addition, I will discuss fair use concerning research for teaching purposes. I 
	believe that fair use concerning research for teaching purposes should allow the user 
	to recreate as many copies of pictures or articles as is needed for instruction as well 
	as one additional copy to be kept on file for later usage. However any full textbooks or 
	novels used during instruction should be properly paid due to the large amount of money, 
	time and effort that goes into the production of such materials. Sections of textbooks or
	 novels should be allowed for use by an instructor under fair use but any substantial enough 
	section should require the book to be bought. <a href="http://www.cmsimpact.org/fair-use/related-materials/codes/code-best-practices-fair-use-scholarly-research-communication#one"> (Source) </a>I believe these fair use materials should only 
	be available without purchase in the classroom or lecture setting and should only be posted 
	online by a non-copyright holder if absolutely necessary and only if its security can be insured.
	 Finally I believe that the fair use materials should not be used for additional assignments 
	created by the students (such as for references in an essay), unless a purchased copy is available 
	to do so. The institution should also have with the copy on file a written report of the materialsâ€™ 
	intended purpose and should include information on the copyright holder if they should need to be contacted <a href="http://www.cmsimpact.org/fair-use/related-materials/codes/code-best-practices-fair-use-scholarly-research-communication#one"> (Source). </a></p>

	<p>Next, research for an individual should have separate prohibitions on proper usage. 
	An individual who wants to use an article, picture or video for personal research should 
	be allowed one copy under fair use, and any additional research used with that information 
	must be properly cited as a source. A full textbook or novel should be allowed to be copied
	 once in the case of personal research. However, the copy created for that individual should not 
	be allowed to be distributed, uploaded to the internet or re-copied by that individual without 
	permission of the copyright holder. All information gained from that material must be credited 
	if ever used in the individuals work. <a href="http://www.cmsimpact.org/fair-use/related-materials/codes/code-best-practices-fair-use-scholarly-research-communication#one"> (Source) </a></p>

	<p>In continuation, criticism should have a different set of policies concerning fair use. 
	Criticism and reviews should be allowed to quote and summarize the material (whether it be an 
	article, picture, video, etc). The material should however be properly cited in all publications
	 of the critique, and context or explanations must be present when necessary so as to not skew the 
	meaning of the copyrighted piece. There should be no parts of written work larger than 7-10 lines at 
	a time. There should also be no criticism that is not directly connected to the copyrighted 
	work (such as insults towards the author, or superficial aspects like the cover of the book) 
	so as to not give inaccurate representations of the piece at hand. Finally the criticism should 
	not in any way directly deter possible consumers of purchasing the copyrighted work, for
	 example making claims of its intentions without direct proof taken from the text itself<a href="http://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/fair-use/what-is-fair-use/"> (Source)</a>.</p>

	<p>Finally, policies of fair use concerning News Reporting. News reporting should be allowed 
	to use parts of copyrighted material through incident, for example a piece of art or a specific 
	sign showing in the background of a news broadcast, however, any re-running of the broadcast must
	 be properly addressed and accredited to the copyright holder<a href="http://www.cmsimpact.org/journalism#one"> (Source) </a>. If segments of the copyrighted work 
	are used to prove a point through a broadcast or news story they should fall under fair use, however,
	 the segment should be as short as is possible to make the point. Any parts of copyrighted material 
	should be allowed to be used in order to clarify a point made by the journalist or to provide history
	 on a specific topic<a href="http://www.cmsimpact.org/journalism#four"> (Source) </a>. This information should be given with complete context, again, so as to not
	 change the inherent meaning of the original, copyrighted information. In addition the whole of a 
	copyrighted work should not be shown unless it is absolutely necessary for the story, such as a picture 
	or a very short video/audio clip, full articles or other written works under copyright law should not be 
	shown on screen or posted on news websites without direct permission from the copyright holder.</p>

	<p>In conclusion, fair use is an important aspect in copyright laws, which allows the copyright holder to gain as much is as 
	fair for themselves, while still providing fair and accessible information for the general public. I believe that all the 
	countries currently under the Berne agreement should follow the same copyright and fair usage laws with as little 
	deviation as possible, and that any possible differences individual countries wish to make be agreed upon by a 
	majority of the other countries in the agreement. If corporations pay the copyright holder for the product they require 
	while the individuals and the schools who require that information still have access to it, then the product can gain 
	popularity and users as well as allow the copyright holder to gain money for creating the product. </p>
